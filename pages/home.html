    <hr />

    <p>
      Pera-Swarm explores the powerful combination of Swarm Robotics and Mixed
      Reality (MR) to create a seamless integration between the real and virtual
      worlds. The project demonstrates how physical robots can interact with
      virtual environments in real time, paving the way for applications that
      merge simulation with tangible operations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Swarm Robotics, inspired by the collective intelligence of nature, focuses
      on how multiple robots can coordinate as a system to perform complex tasks
      efficiently. When enhanced with Mixed Reality, these robot swarms are not
      only visible in their physical form but can also be extended, manipulated,
      and observed in immersive digital spaces.
    </p>

    <h4>Why It Matters</h4>

    This integration of robotics and MR has transformative potential in domains
    such as:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Smart Cities</b>: modeling and managing urban infrastructure in real
        time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Disaster Response</b>: simulating emergency situations while
        deploying real-world robot teams.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Education & Research</b>: providing an interactive platform for
        students and researchers to experiment with robotics and simulations.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Industry Applications</b>: optimizing logistics, automation, and
        resource management through real-virtual synergy.
      </li>
    </ul>
