    <hr />

    <p>
      Pera-Swarm explores the powerful combination of Swarm Robotics and Mixed Reality (MR) to
      create a seamless integration between the real and virtual worlds. The project demonstrates
      how physical robots can interact with virtual environments in real time, paving the way for
      applications that merge simulation with tangible operations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Swarm Robotics, inspired by the collective intelligence of nature, focuses on how multiple
      robots can coordinate as a system to perform complex tasks efficiently. When enhanced with
      Mixed Reality, these robot swarms are not only visible in their physical form but can also be
      extended, manipulated, and observed in immersive digital spaces.
    </p>

    <h4>Why It Matters</h4>

    This integration of robotics and MR has transformative potential in domains such as:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Smart Cities</b>
        : modeling and managing urban infrastructure in real time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Disaster Response</b>
        : simulating emergency situations while deploying real-world robot teams.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Education & Research</b>
        : providing an interactive platform for students and researchers to experiment with robotics
        and simulations.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Industry Applications</b>
        : optimizing logistics, automation, and resource management through real-virtual synergy.
      </li>
    </ul>
