Pera Swarm's Swarm Capable and Reconfigurable Agent is its first modular robot system, designed to overcome the limited scope of tasks typically associated with ordinary swarm robots. It aims to offer,

- Modularity: Achieved through universal ports on the base robot, allowing for the easy attachment and detachment of a variety of modules for versatile functionality.
- Swarm Capability: Coordinate multiple robots to perform complex tasks efficiently.
- IoT Integration: Real-time connectivity and data sharing for enhanced coordination.
- User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive control through browser and mobile applications.
- Scalability: Expand the swarm by adding more robots and modules as needed.
