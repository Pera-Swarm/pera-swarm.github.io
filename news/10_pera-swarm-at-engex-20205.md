The Department of Computer Engineering, University of Peradeniya, is proud to present Pera-Swarm, an innovative research project, at __EngEx 2025__, the grand exhibition celebrating the 75th Anniversary of the Faculty of Engineering.

Visitors can experience Pera-Swarm at the __"Smart City by PeraCom"__ stall during the exhibition, which will run from September __23 to 28, 2025 at the University of Peradeniya__. The showcase will feature:

- Live demonstrations of coordinated robot behaviors
- Mixed reality visual overlays for situational awareness
- Interactive control and monitoring dashboards
- Insights into research on autonomy, communication, and safety

This exhibition aims to inspire students, researchers, and industry partners to engage with next-generation cyber-physical systems. Team members will be available to discuss technical architecture, deployment frameworks, and opportunities for collaboration.

Be sure to stop by the __"Smart City by PeraCom"__ stall at __EngEx 2025__ and witness how Pera-Swarm is redefining the boundaries of innovation.

For collaboration or academic inquiries, please reach out to the project team during the exhibition days.
